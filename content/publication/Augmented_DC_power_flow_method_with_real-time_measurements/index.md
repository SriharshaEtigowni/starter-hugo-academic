abstract: An augmented DC power flow (augDC-PF) method is proposed that achieves both speed and accuracy compared to existing linear algorithms. Many applications necessitate both but are limited by the trade-off that exists within traditional power flow methods. Speed focused algorithms such as DC power flow involve severe approximations that result in an imprecise solution. The augDC-PF method is derived similar to the improved DC power flow (impDC-PF) algorithm by Lu et al. but uses real-time measurements rather than historical data to remedy its drawbacks. By using these real-time measurements from devices such as PMUs, the augDC-PF method is more accurate, reflects the current operating point, can handle topology changes, and reduces computational overhead. The effects of using a reduced set of real-time measurements is also explored, with or without full system observability. The resultant method is versatile and can be useful in a variety of applications, as exemplified by a control input verification case study.
